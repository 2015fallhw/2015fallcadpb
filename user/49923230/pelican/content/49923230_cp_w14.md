The reviews of using Onshape and collaborate with teammate
--------------------------------------

Onshape is a fantastic browser app for CAD 3D design. People and collaborate with teammate  on the smae working page. And the interface is really simple to operate, just like solidworks. I think it's going to be very populer because of its convinience. People don't need to bring their heavy laptop anymore. Becauese it supports the pad and smartphone, which makes people and work or show the design wherever they want.
