The reviews of whole semester
--------------------------------------

It's really cool that professor taught us not only about CAD, but also a lot of value system and growing trend of technology of the world. I didn't anything about github before, cuz I didn't have that much interested in programming. But I realize that it's also a trend in the world. It's almost becoming a basic knowledge for every single person. It's a awsome couse I can ever have. And also professor always mention about how important of having good english skill. So that's why I tried to do most of the assignment in english instead of chinese. In the future, we will face all the competitor from all over the world. And english will be the basic skill for us.
